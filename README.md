# BalaramaEngine

BalaramaEngine is a high-performance chess engine designed to be fast, flexible, and easy to integrate with different chess platforms. It utilizes advanced search algorithms, an efficient evaluation function, and a robust architecture to provide strong play.

This project is open-source and can be freely used, modified, and distributed under the terms of the MIT License.

## Features

- **Alpha-Beta Search:** Implements a basic Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm for optimal move exploration.
- **Efficient Evaluation Function:** Uses a well-tuned evaluation function to assess board positions.
- **Customizable and Extensible:** Users can modify and extend the engineâ€™s features, including search depth, evaluation parameters, and more.

## Installation

- **C++ Compiler:** A C++14 (or later) compatible compiler is required.
- **SDL2:** SDL2 is used to handle graphical rendering and input events, SDL_Image is used for rendering pieces and SDL_TTF for text.

### SDL2 Installation
